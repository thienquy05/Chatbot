I completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera, which gave me a broad, practical foundation in real-world cybersecurity. The course covered core concepts such as the CIA triad and AAA, as well as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). I gained hands-on experience with Linux and common security tooling, including Nmap for network scanning and John the Ripper for password testing.  

The training also covered network concepts (how ports work and how to harden networks), fundamentals of encryption (symmetric vs. asymmetric), and how secure websites are established (TLS/HTTPS). I practiced using analysis and monitoring tools such as Wireshark and Splunk, and strengthened my scripting and data skills with Python and SQL.  

I plan to keep building on this foundation by applying these skills to real-world labs and internship projects to deepen practical experience in threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability mitigation.

Now, I'm continuously pursuing CompTIA A+ Certificate and aiming to finish CompTIA Security+ Certificate before graduation.
