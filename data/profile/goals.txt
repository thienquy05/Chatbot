My dream job is to work in a computer environment, especially in cybersecurity. I find this field deeply interesting because it allows us to defend systems and data from malicious actors.

I understand that cybersecurity requires being proactive and continuously learning to stay ahead of new threats. Keeping knowledge up-to-date is essential to identify vulnerabilities and generate effective patches.

I commit myself to learning new things every day and seeking hands-on experience to strengthen my skills. Currently, I am looking for an internship to gain real-world experience where I can apply my technical skills while continuing to learn and grow as a cybersecurity professional.
