I am a curious and continuously learning person. I work hard and dedicate time every day to improve my skills and knowledge. 
I love technology and have a deep passion for cybersecurity concepts. My goal is to help people protect their information and assets from threat actors.

I was born in Vietnam and am currently attending the University of Toledo as a junior majoring in Computer Science with a GPA of 3.6. 
My dream job is to work in a technology-focused environment, especially in cybersecurity, and I am determined to make that dream a reality. 
I can speak both Vietnamese and English, which allows me to connect with people from different backgrounds.

I enjoy playing sports, which keeps me active and disciplined. Fun fact — I know how to play around 7–8 sports, including basketball, badminton, pickleball, spikeball, volleyball, soccer, billiards, bowling, and even ice skating or snow sports. 
My main sports are basketball, badminton, and pickleball; the others I just play for fun!

I consider myself proactive and flexible, always ensuring that I finish everything on or before time. 
I believe in self-improvement, problem-solving, and taking initiative to make positive changes in both my personal and professional life.
